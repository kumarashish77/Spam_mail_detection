# 📧 Spam Email Detection using Python & NLTK

This is a machine learning project for detecting spam emails using **Python** and the **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**. It applies basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify emails as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**.

## 🚀 Features

- Preprocessing of email texts (tokenization, stemming, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction using **Bag of Words**
- Model training using **Naive Bayes classifier**
- Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision/recall
- Easy-to-understand code structure

## 🧰 Libraries Used

- `nltk` - Natural Language Processing (tokenization, stopwords, stemming)
- `sklearn` - Machine Learning tools (model training and evaluation)
- `pandas` - Data manipulation
- `numpy` - Numerical operations

## 📁 Dataset

The project uses a dataset with labeled email messages (`spam` or `ham`). You can use the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) from Kaggle.

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-email-detection.git
